= Introduction

We consider a multi-state model with at most one visitation time for the treatment (that is at most one point where treatment may change), 
no time-varying covariates, and no baseline covariates. In the initial state (0) everyone starts as treated.
We consider the setting with no censoring. 
The multi-state model is shown in @fig:multi-state.
We observe the counting processes $N_t = (N^(01)_t, N^(02)_t, N^(03)_t, N^(13)_t, N^(23)_t)$
on the canonical filtered probability space $(Omega, cal(F), (cal(F)_t)_(t >= 0), P)$,
where $cal(F)_t = sigma(N_s | s <= t)$.
This means that we can represent the observed data as $O = (T_((1)), D_((1)), A(T_((1))), T_((2)))$,
where $T_((1))$ is the first event time, $D_((1)) in {01, 02, 03}$ is the first event type, $A(T_(1)) in {0, 1}$ is the treatment at the first event time, and $T_((2))$ is the second event time, possibly $oo$.
We will assume that the distribution of the jump times are continuous and that there are no jumps in common between the counting processes.
By a well-known result for marked point processes (Proposition 3.1 of @jacod1975multivariate), we know 
there exist functions $h^(i j): RR_+ -> RR_+$
such that the compensators $Lambda^(i j)$ of the counting processes $N^(i j)$ with respect to $P-cal(F)_t$ are given by
$
    Lambda^(0 j) (d t) &= bb(1) {t <= T_((1))} h^(0 j) (t) d t, quad j = 1, 2, 3 \
    Lambda^(i 3) (d t) &= bb(1) {T_((1)) < t <= T_((2))} h^(i 3) (t) d t, quad i = 2, 3
$

//As always, we will assume finite-variation martingales in the below, so that our underlying assumption that the counting proceses have no jumps in common implies that the martingales are orthogonal).

Additionally define
$
    Lambda^(a) (t) &= (h^(01) (t) + h^(02) (t)) bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} \
    pi_t (1) &= (h^(01) (t))/(h^(01) (t) + h^(02) (t))  bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t}
$
Here, we can interpret $Lambda^(a) (t)$ as the intensity of the visitation times and $pi_t (1)$ as the probability of being treated given that you go to the doctor at time $t$.

= The potential outcomes framework
To follow along @ryalenPotentialOutcomes, we restrict the observations to the interval $[0, tau]$ for $tau > 0$.
We first need to define the intervention of interest,
defining the counting processes that we would have like to have observed under the intervention.
For this define the corresponding "interventional" processes as
$
    N^(g,0)_t &= 0 \
    N^(g,1)_t &= N^(01)_t + N^(02)_t \
$
instead of $N^(01)_t$, $N^(02)_t$. This treatment regime defines that the doctor always treats the patient at the visitation time
and does not prevent the patient from visiting the doctor if they drop out of the treatment.
In contrast, the single "intervention" process
$
    N^(g^*,0)_t &= 0 \
    N^(g^*,1)_t &= N^(02)_t \
$
prevents the patient from visiting the doctor if they drop out of the treatment.
We define $T^a$ as the first time where the observed and the interventional process deviate.
The issue in @ryalenPotentialOutcomes is that we will not be able to differentiate between $g$ and $g^*$ in the likelihood.
The reason is that the likelihood under the intervention only depends on the stopping time $T^a$ and the problem that the stopping time
$T^a$ is the same under $g$ and $g^*$.
//The compensator of the two counting processes are
//$
//    Lambda^(g,0) (d t) &= 0 \
//    Lambda^(g,1) (d t) &= h^(a) (t) pi_t (1) d t + h^(a) (t) (1 - pi_t (1)) d t = h^(a) (t) d t
//$
We let $T^ag= T^(ag^*) = inf_(t>0) {N^(g,0)_t != N^(01)_t} and inf_(t>0) {N^(g,1)_t != N^(02)_t} = inf_(t>0) {N^(g,0)_t != 0}$.
The outcome of interest is death at time $t$, i.e., 
$
    Y_t = N^(13)_t + N^(03)_t + N^(23)_t = bb(1) {T_1 <= t, D_1 = y} + bb(1) {T_2 <= t}
$
and we want to estimate $bb(E)_P [tilde(Y)_t]$ where $tilde(Y)_t$ denotes the outcome at time $t$, had the treatment regime (staying on treatment), possibly contrary to fact, been followed.

#theorem([Theorem 1 of @ryalenPotentialOutcomes])[
    We suppose that there exists a potential outcome process $(tilde(Y)_t)_(t in [0,tau])$ such that

1. Consistency: $tilde(Y)_t bb(1) {T^A > t} = Y_t bb(1) {T^A > t}$ for all $t > 0$ $P$-a.s.
2. Exchangeability: The $P-cal(F)_t$ compensators 
   $Lambda^(01)$, $Lambda^(02)$ are also compensators for $cal(G)_t=cal(F)_t or sigma(tilde(Y)_s, tau >= s >= 0)$.
   Here $tilde(Y)_s$ is added at baseline, so that $cal(G)_0 = sigma(tilde(Y)_s, tau >= s >= 0)$.
3. Positivity: $W_t = (bb(1) {T^A > t}) / exp(-Lambda_t^02) = (1-bb(1){T_((1)) <= t, D_((1)) = a, A_((1)) = 0}) / exp(-integral_0^t bb(1) {s <= T_((1))} h^(a) (s) pi_s (0) d s)$
   is a uniformly integrable martingale or equivalently that $R^"P책l"$ given by $d R^"P책l" = W_tau d P$ is a probability measure.

Then the estimand of interest is identifiable by
$
    bb(E)_P [tilde(Y)_t] = bb(E)_P [Y_t W_t] = bb(E)_(R^"P책l") [Y_t]
$
]

We are now in a position, where we can readily compare the approaches in @rytgaardContinuoustimeTargetedMinimum2022 and
@ryalenPotentialOutcomes. Generally speaking the likelihood factorizes as,
by the orthogonal martingale assumption, 
$
    d "P" &= exp(- Lambda^01 (d t) - Lambda^02 (d t) - Lambda^03 (d t)) (Lambda^01 (d t))^(N^01 (d t)) (Lambda^02 (d t))^(N^02 (d t)) (Lambda^03 (d t))^(N^03 (d t)) \
        &times exp(- Lambda^13 (d t)) (Lambda^(13) (d t))^(N^(13) (d t)) times exp(- Lambda^23 (d t)) (Lambda^(23) (d t))^(N^(23) (d t)) \
        &= exp(-Lambda^03 (d t) - Lambda^a (d t)) (pi_(t) (1) Lambda^a (d t))^(N^(01) (d t)) ((1-pi_(t) (1)) Lambda^a (d t))^(N^(02) (d t)) (Lambda^03 (d t))^(N^03 (d t)) \
        &times exp(- Lambda^13 (d t)) (Lambda^(13) (d t))^(N^(13) (d t)) times exp(- Lambda^23 (d t)) (Lambda^(23) (d t))^(N^(23) (d t)) \
        &= exp(-Lambda^03 (d t)-Lambda^a (d t)) (Lambda^03 (d t))^(N^03 (d t)) exp(- Lambda^13 (d t)) (Lambda^(13) (d t))^(N^(13) (d t)) times exp(- Lambda^23 (d t)) (Lambda^(23) (d t))^(N^(23) (d t)) \
        &(Lambda^a (d t))^(N^(01) (d t)) ((1-pi_(t) (1)))^(N^(02) (d t)) times (pi_(t) (1))^(N^(01) (d t)) ((1-pi_(t) (1)))^(N^(02) (d t)) \
        &= d Q times d G
$
where
$
    d Q &= exp(-Lambda^03 (d t)) (Lambda^03 (d t))^(N^03 (d t)) exp(- Lambda^13 (d t)) (Lambda^(13) (d t))^(N^(13) (d t)) times exp(- Lambda^23 (d t)) (Lambda^(23) (d t))^(N^(23) (d t))\
        & times exp(-Lambda^a (d t)) (Lambda^a (d t))^(N^(01) (d t)) ((1-pi_(t) (1)))^(N^(02) (d t)) \
    d G &= (pi_(t) (1) )^(N^(01) (d t)) ((1-pi_(t) (1)) )^(N^(02) (d t)) 
$
@rytgaardContinuoustimeTargetedMinimum2022 define their target estimand as $bb(E)_(R^"Helene") [Y_t]$, where
$
    d "R"^"Helene" &= d Q (d t) times d G^* (d t)
$
where
$
    d G^* (d t) = (1)^(N^(01) (d t)) (0)^(N^(02) (d t)) \
$
In contrast, in @ryalenPotentialOutcomes, we have that, by simple multiplication,
$
    d "R"^"P책l" &= W (d t) d "P" =
    exp(-Lambda^03 (d t)) (Lambda^03 (d t))^(N^03 (d t)) exp(- Lambda^13 (d t)) (Lambda^(13) (d t))^(N^(13) (d t)) times exp(- Lambda^23 (d t)) (Lambda^(23) (d t))^(N^(23) (d t)) \
        &times exp(- pi_(t) (1) Lambda^a (d t)) (pi_(t) (1) Lambda^a (d t))^(N^(01) (d t)) (0)^(N^(02) (d t)) \
$
which does not factorize into $Q$ and $G$-part of the likelihood. 
This argument may be made more rigorous by applying Theorem 3 of @ryalenPotentialOutcomes,
finding the compensators in the reweighted measure $d R^"P책l"$.

= Does the g-formula in @rytgaardContinuoustimeTargetedMinimum2022 have a causal interpretation? 

We now consider the question concerning whether there is a causal interpretation of the g-formula in @rytgaardContinuoustimeTargetedMinimum2022.
A simple result is given in the following theorem. Note that we can also formulated the exchangeability condition for each $t$ separately
instead of formulating stochastic process conditions. 

#theorem[
    We suppose that there exists a potential outcome process $(tilde(Y)_t)_(t in [0,tau])$ such that

1. Consistency: $tilde(Y)_t bb(1) {T^A > t} = Y_t bb(1) {T^A > t}$ for all $t > 0$ $P$-a.s.
2. Exchangeability: We have
   $
       (tilde(Y)_t)_(t in [0,tau]) perp A(T_((1))) | T_((1)), D_((1)) 
   $
3. Positivity: The measure given by $d R^"Helene" = W d P$ where $W_t = ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_(1)) (1)))^(N_t^01 +N^02_t)$ is a probability measure.

Then the estimand of interest is identifiable by
$
    bb(E)_P [tilde(Y)_t] = bb(E)_P [Y_t W_t] = bb(E)_(R^"Helene") [Y_t]
$
]
#proof[
    Write $tilde(Y)_t = bb(1) {t < T_((1))} tilde(Y)_t + bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} tilde(Y)_t$
    Now, we see immediately that
    $
        bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {t < T_((1))} tilde(Y)_t] &= bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {t < T_((1))} tilde(Y)_t bb(1) {T^a > t}] \
            &= bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {t < T_((1))} Y_t bb(1) {T^a > t}] \
            &= bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {t < T_((1))} Y_t] \
            &= bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {t < T_((1))} Y_t W_t] \
    $
    since $T^a$ must be $T_((1))$ if finite.  
    On the other hand, we have that
    $
        bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} Y_t W_t] &= bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} bb(1) {T^a > t} Y_t W_t] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} bb(1) {T^a > t} tilde(Y)_t W_t] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} tilde(Y)_t W_t] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} tilde(Y)_t ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a})] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} tilde(Y)_t | A(T_((1))), D_1, T_1] ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a})] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} tilde(Y)_t | D_1, T_1] ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a})] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} tilde(Y)_t | D_1, T_1] bb(E)_P [((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a}) | T_1, D_1]] \
            &= bb(E)_P [ bb(E)_P [ bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} tilde(Y)_t | D_1, T_1] ] \
            &= bb(E)_P [  bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t} tilde(Y)_t ]
    $
    which suffices to show the claim.
]

With more than two events, though, the exchangeability condition becomes more difficult to interpret.
In the case with at most three events, for the previous argument to go through, we would need the three exchangeability conditions
$
    (tilde(Y)_t bb(1) {T_((1)) <= t < T_((2))})_(t in [0,tau]) perp A(T_((1))) | T_((1)), D_((1)), \
    (tilde(Y)_t bb(1) {T_((2)) <= t})_(t in [0,tau]) perp A(T_((1))) | T_((1)), D_((1)), \
    (tilde(Y)_t)_(t in [0,tau]) perp A(T_((2))) | T_((2)), D_((2)), A(T_((1))), T_((1)), D_((1)), \
$
It would be interesting to see if there are some explicit conditions such that
$
    (tilde(Y)_t)_(t in [0,tau]) perp A(T_((1))) | T_((1)), D_((1)) 
$
implies the two first exchangeability conditions. An obvious one is if the event times are independent of the treatment given the history
which is unlikely to hold.

The next theorem gives a different causal interpretation of the g-formula in @rytgaardContinuoustimeTargetedMinimum2022.
Unlike the previous theorem, the exchangeability wont have to be specified in terms of $tilde(Y)_t$ multiplied by a stochastic indicator function
if there are more than two events. This issue is however that we are assuming the existence of multiple potential outcome processes and not just one.

#theorem[
    We suppose that there exists two potential outcome process $(tilde(Y)_(t,1))_(t in [0,tau])$ and $(tilde(Y)_(t,2))_(t in [0,tau])$ such that
    these are potential outcomes of $Y_(t,1) = N^(03)_t$ and $Y_(t,2) = N^(13)_t+N^(23)_t$, respectively (the potential outcomes for each possible event where the outcome can occur).
    Then we obviously define that
    $tilde(Y)_t = tilde(Y)_(t,1) + tilde(Y)_(t,2)$ and $Y_t = Y_(t,1) + Y_(t,2)$.

    1. Consistency: $tilde(Y)_(t,i) bb(1) {T^A > t} = Y_(t,i) bb(1) {T^A > t}$ for all $t > 0$ $P$-a.s for $i = 1, 2$.
2. Exchangeability: We have
   $
       (tilde(Y)_(t,i))_(t in [0,tau]) perp A(T_((1))) | T_((1)), D_((1)) 
   $
   for $i = 1, 2$.
3. Positivity: The measure given by $d R^"Helene" = W d P$ where $W_t = ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_(1)) (1)))^(N_t^01 +N^02_t)$ is a probability measure.

Then the estimand of interest is identifiable by
$
    bb(E)_P [tilde(Y)_t] = bb(E)_P [Y_t W_t] = bb(E)_(R^"Helene") [Y_t]
$
]
#proof[
    Now, we see immediately that
    $
        bb(E)_P [ Y_(t,1) W_t ] &= bb(E)_P [ tilde(Y)_(t,1) ]
    $
    because $tilde(Y)_(t,1)$ is always $Y_(t,1)$.
    On the other hand, we have that
    $
        bb(E)_P [  Y_(t,2) W_t ] &=  bb(E)_P [  Y_(t,2) ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a}) ]\
            &=bb(E)_P [  tilde(Y)_(t,2) ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a})] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(E)_P [ tilde(Y)_(t,2) | A(T_((1))), D_1, T_1] ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a})] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(E)_P [ tilde(Y)_(t,2) | D_1, T_1] ((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a})] \
            &=bb(E)_P [ bb(E)_P [ tilde(Y)_(t,2) | D_1, T_1] bb(E)_P [((bb(1) {A(T_((1))) = 1}) / (pi_(T_((1))) (1)))^(bb(1) {D_((1)) = a}) | T_1, D_1]] \
            &= bb(E)_P [ bb(E)_P [ tilde(Y)_(t,2) | D_1, T_1] ] \
            &= bb(E)_P [  tilde(Y)_(t,2) ]
    $
    which suffices to show the claim.
